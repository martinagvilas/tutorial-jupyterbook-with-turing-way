    "\n",
    "### Installing Jupyter Book and other Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this tutorial uses Jupyter Book (version 0.8.0) locally on personal computer.\n",
    "You can install the Jupyter Book Command Line Interface (CLI) using the command `pip install -U jupyter-book`, which will allow you to build and control your Jupyter Book. \n",
    "However, for this tutorial we will also need other Python packages (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and ruamel.yaml), which have been listed in the `requirements.txt` in the main repository of this tutorial. \n",

    "### Launch this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with Jupyter Notebooks, we need to launch it.\n",
    "- Please use the [Software Carpentry lesson setup page](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html#option-a-jupyter-notebook) to launch Jupyter Notebooks locally: follow the steps listed only under [*Option A: Jupyter Notebook*](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html#option-a-jupyter-notebook).\n",
    "- When you have launched your Jupyter Notebook in your browser, please navigate to the folder `jupytercon_tutorial-master` we downloaded in the previous section or `jupytercon_tutorial` if cloned the GitHub repository. Click to open the file `1-welcome.ipynb` inside `notebooks` folder.\n",
